    <h3> Information About Harry Potter Series</h3>
    
    <p>The Harry Potter series was invented none other than J. K. Rowling. For me and most likely a bunch of other poeple Rowling has bein a giganitc inpact on our lives. According to the website   Business Insider Worldwide, "Harry Potter" books have sold more than 450 million copies. The next highest series is "Lord of the Rings," by J.R.R. Tolkien, at a comparably paltry 150 million copies.</p>
   
    <p>The world of harry potter is a very interesting topic in my opinion. Because its feels as if when you read the books or even whach a re-run on ABC family it has the tendency to lift up your spirits when bad things come to play in your life. The series makes you feel like you belong or fit in. for example in the books/movies there are houses that the kids at hogwarts get sorted in to soming like the frist day of school when you get sorted in to a new class group. In hogwarts there are for houses (classes) <a href="https://skiffleboom.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/harrypotter_hogwarts_bookmarks_skiffleboom.jpg">Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and lastly ravenclaw.</a></p>
   
    <h4>How did Rowling Come to the idea of Harry Potter</h4>
    
    <p>According to Google.com "J.K. Rowling first had the idea for Harry Potter while delayed on a train travelling from Manchester to London King's Cross in 1990. Over the next five years, she began to plan out the seven books of the series. She wrote mostly in longhand and amassed a mountain of notes, many of which were on scraps of paper". <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/">Click Here To Learn More About J.K Roling And The World Of Harry Potter.</a></p>
